🔗 **Live Site:** [https://inunity.in/careers/]

## 🖥️ Description
I contributed to the development of the InUnity Careers page by designing and structuring the layout using Elementor Pro, ensuring a modern and responsive user experience. I utilized Envato Elements kits to maintain design consistency with the rest of the site and implemented essential SEO practices using Yoast SEO. Alongside building the Careers page, I also made content and design updates on the main website, aligning with the brand’s visual identity and improving user navigation. This work highlights my ability to use advanced WordPress tools to create dynamic, editable, and SEO-optimized web pages within an existing live environment.
